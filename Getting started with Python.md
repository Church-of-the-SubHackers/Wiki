# Getting Started With Python

This article serves as an entrypoint for those looking to learn to program in Python.

# What Can Be Done With Python

It's sometimes useful to choose a language based on its strengths in a particular area or your intended goals. Here are some of the areas where Python really shines bright.

## Machine Learning and Data Science

Python is preferred for machine learning and data science.

We can compute the complicated math equations using Python with effortless. We have libraries like pandas, numpy, matplotlib, etc.., which helps machine learning engineers and data scientists.

## Web Development

There are frameworks out there for web development in Python.

The most popular web frameworks for Python are Django and Flask. Django is a more robust framework than Flask. You can develop a simple website to complex web application using these frameworks.  Both frameworks are beginner-friendly and easy to learn with the documentation.

## Web Scraping
Web scraping is one of the main areas of Python.

We can make web crawlers in Python with a library called scrapy, BeautifulSoup4, and many others for scraping the data.

## Scripting
You can do literally anything to automate repetitive sysadmin tasks.

- Interacting with OS (Windows, UNIX, etc.)
- Performing maintenance
- Deploying an application
- Website testing
- Downloading data

# Books vs Courses

Everyone is different in how they learn and so there is no best answer for whether it is better to learn by reading books or by taking online courses. 

Books and courses generally suffer from the same pitfalls:

- Claim to be intended for beginners but do not take the time to indoctrinate true beginners, thus making assumptions about prior knowledge and frustrating beginners.
- Gloss over the "building blocks" creating gaps in knowledge
- Not providing adequate challenges or "homework" for beginners to use what they have learned to create or modify programs which test their understanding of the material

Because of these pitfalls it is advised to read more than one book or take more than one class. While it may be boring sitting through another explanation of basics you've already learned, different sources often provide different explanations of a concept which will either increase your understanding of the concept, or help demystify a concept.

# Books

## Absolute Beginners

These books are intended for absolute beginners whom have never learned any programming language and have chosen Python to be their first language.

- **Automate the Boring Stuff with Python 2nd Edition** 
> A true no-prior experience book that focuses on practical applications of Python. Plenty of resources are provided in this book alongside enough practice projects to build your portfolio and ensure you understand the concepts presented.

## Some Experience

These books are intended for those whom either know another language and are looking to pick up some more intermediate level familiarity with Python, or those whom have previously read a book or taken a course from the Absolute Beginners section.

- **Beyond the Basic Stuff with Python**
> Intended as a follow-up to "Automate the Boring Stuff with Python", this book covers software development tools and best practices which will enable you to write professional code. "Beyond the Basic Stuff with Python" will bridge the gap between Novice and Professional.

## Python for Hackers

These books are intended to provide practical applications of Python within the context of Cybersecurity. While they can be read by beginners and novices, it is recommended that you have a good grasp on Python before reading these books.

- **Grey Hat Python**
> Gray Hat Python explains the concepts behind hacking tools and techniques like debuggers, trojans, fuzzers, and emulators. But author Justin Seitz goes beyond theory, showing you how to harness existing Python-based security tools—and how to build your own when the pre-built ones won't cut it.
>
> You'll learn how to:
>
> - Automate tedious reversing and security tasks
> - Design and program your own debugger
> - Learn how to fuzz Windows drivers and create powerful fuzzers from scratch
> - Have fun with code and library injection, soft and hard hooking techniques, and other software trickery
> - Sniff secure traffic out of an encrypted web browser session
> - Use PyDBG, Immunity Debugger, Sulley, IDAPython, PyEMU, and more

- **Black Hat Python 2nd Edition**
> You’ll learn how to:
>
> - Create a trojan command-and-control server using GitHub
> - Detect sandboxing and automate common malware tasks like keylogging and screenshotting
> - Extend the Burp Suite web-hacking tool
> - Escalate Windows privileges with creative process control
> - Use offensive memory forensics tricks to retrieve password hashes and find vulnerabilities on a virtual machine
> - Abuse Windows COM automation
> - Exfiltrate data from a network undetected
> - When it comes to offensive security, you need to be able to create powerful tools on the fly. Learn how with Black Hat Python.

# Online Classes & Videos

## Absolute Beginners

These courses are intended for absolute beginners whom have never learned any programming language and have chosen Python to be their first language.

- [Codecademy Free Python 3 course](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-python-3)
> This course is a great introduction to both fundamental programming concepts and the Python programming language. Python 3 is the most up-to-date version of the language with many improvements made to increase the efficiency and simplicity of the code that you write.

## Some Experience
These courses are intended for those whom either know another language and are looking to pick up some more intermediate level familiarity with Python, or those whom have previously read a book or taken a course from the Absolute Beginners section.

- [freeCodeCamp.org Intermediate Python course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGOBQPFzWKo)
> Take your Python skills to the next level with this intermediate Python course. First, you will get a review of basic concepts such as lists, strings, and dictionaries, but with an emphasis on some lesser known capabilities. Then, you will learn more advanced topics such as threading, multiprocessing, context managers, generators, and more.
