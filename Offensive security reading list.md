# Getting Started With Offensive Security: Reading List

This list has been created to serve as a roadmap style study guide for anyone interested in learning about Offensive Security. Readers are encouraged to work through any projects, problems, and exercises provided by the books as this will ensure concepts covered are firmly understood.

While the books can be read in any order, time has been taken to arrange the list in an order that provides a logical progression through the material and as such it is recommended that you work your way from top to bottom.

> This is in no way an exhaustive list of materials and this page is subject to change as new books are published and older books become irrelevant.

1.[Getting Started With Python](/getting-started/Getting-Started-With-Python): Read this article and then read Automate the Boring Stuff with Python 2nd Edition, Beyond the Basic Stuff with Python, Grey Hat Python, and Black Hat Python 2nd Edition in that order.

2.[The Hacker Playbook 2](https://www.amazon.com/Hacker-Playbook-Practical-Penetration-Testing/dp/1512214566): Ensure it is Playbook 2 and not Playbook 3 as they are not different editions of the same book but two completely different books
